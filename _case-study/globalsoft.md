## Globalsoft re-engineers and refactors consumption of key technologies with Skill Sprint from Darwinist

Globalsoft is a software development company based near Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina. With a staff of around 15 engineers Globalsoft undertakes software engineering work for customers around the world. With the IT market in BiH rapidly heating up GlobalSoft CEO, Drago Ćorić has to work hard to find new people and keep his engineers happy.

GlobalSoft has been working heavily with Darwinist for Employee investment. Darwinists Skill Sprint methodology has enabled the business to upskill employees whilst getting a direct benefit for the business.

# Kubernetes

Three software developers, Daniel, Mario and Jozo were guided by Skill Sprint leader, Andrew Holway to completely re-engineer the CI-CD and DevOps structure of several applications. The participants learned how to independently deploy and manage their applications on Kubernetes. By the end of the process the developers were able to quickly and efficiently perform the same work on other projects without any further support. 

# Elasticsearch

Jilles van Gurp, Elasticsearch Savant helped Filip, Mateo and Tomislav to completely re-engineer the way an application used Elasticsearch by creating a new Golang search microservice from scratch using the best practice. The participants learned best practice and gained direct hands on experience with how to use elasticsearch for other projects.

# Golang

Globalsoft is primarily a PHP shop but many customers are demanding better performance - especially better latency. To serve these customers Globalsoft invested in two Golang Skill Sprints - each focussing on creating a Golang microservice to relieve pressure on a PHP monolith.
