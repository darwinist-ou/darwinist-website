# Camping.info retools using a Kubernetes Skill Sprint to meet major deadline

Germany’s camping.info is the leading online portal for camping enthusiasts, with a database of over 23,000 campsites across 44 European countries. German-speaking campers worldwide consult camping.info’s guides and apps, and share their own experiences with members of the community. Each campsite record contains specific site information and ratings from users, so the site’s technical infrastructure needs to be both flexible and powerful.



## A pressing need for new infrastructure

Since acquiring the camping.info domain and portal two years ago, the team had placed great focus on completely revamping its functionality, look and feel. With an open beta launch and rebranding on the horizon for the end of 2019, CTO Florian Finke knew that any major technical issues needed to be addressed in order to move forward.

Camping.info could not ignore its biggest issue any longer: it was dealing with messy technical infrastructure that was too difficult to handle.
It’s no easy task to develop and maintain search and filtering for over 23,000 campsites, all with multiple features and properties. Finke and his team required intelligent clustering and flexible infrastructure to quickly make changes as needed. Unfortunately, a legacy setup on Amazon Web Services (AWS) wasn’t getting the job done.

<p class="box has-background-dark">“We had a complicated AWS Terraform setup”, Finke said. “We weren’t satisfied with it, none of us could handle it and we needed a change.”</p>



## The Skill Sprint method

Finke began looking for a solution and eventually found it in Kubernetes, Google’s cluster and container management tool famed for being developer friendly. Camping.info decided to move forward with the technology and inquired about ways to outsource the migration. Cloudwürdig, the longest operating Google Cloud partner in the DACH region and leading expert in cloud adoption techniques came recommended.

<p class="box has-background-dark">“Initially, I didn’t want to have this task on my table. I wanted to outsource it.” Finke said. “I thought that training up our own team would be expensive and time consuming, and that we would almost certainly still need a consultant to help with the migration. However, a specialist from Cloudwürdig explained a different method to me: the Skill Sprint. We would handle the migration ourselves under the guidance of an expert.”</p>

The principle of the Skill Sprint method is that technical knowledge is developed in-house on a live project. Led by a Skill Sprint expert, two or more developers work for a single week as they implement new technology. At the end of the week, the developers have a new understanding of this technology and a sense of ownership over the product they built.

Although the most powerful Skill Sprints involve two or more participants and a subject matter expert, this instance saw Finke working as the sole developer to achieve this migration to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). During his Skill Sprint, he learned to maintain the very infrastructure he was building.Despite the downsized setup, a significant portion of infrastructure was moved over to GKE. Most importantly, Finke was able to replicate the Skill Sprints among his team so that they all now own their new infrastructure. 



## A welcome change at a critical time

<p class="box has-background-dark">“It was an ambitious goal to migrate everything  to GKE in one week, and we almost made it.” Finke said. “I then did two mini Skill Sprints with two of my developers, so they are also able to maintain this.”</p>

Finke and his team are thrilled to be moving forward with their beta launch with newfound ease. This change, facilitated by the Skill Sprint, brought the power of Kubernetes, Google Cloud and technical ownership to a busy team at a critical time.

<p class="box has-background-dark">“Before the Skill Sprint, I was not able to maintain or make changes in the way I needed to”, Finke said. “Now, I’m in full control and able to add new projects and microservices to the Kubernetes cluster. Plus, I adopted the Skill Sprint method within our team and it went quite well. I’m very happy about it.“</p>

Camping.info is poised for success in creating a truly user-centric platform for camping enthusiasts. With help from its partnership with Cloudwürdig, the company now feels better equipped to tackle its ambitious year ahead.
