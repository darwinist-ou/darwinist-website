# [Humanitec](https://humanitec.com/) charts path around DevOps bottleneck with guidance from Darwinist.

Humanitec is a Berlin-based platform-as-a-service company that enables ops teams to build and maintain their own internal platforms using open-source resource drivers. When Humanitec CTO Greg Lind approached Darwinist in July 2018, he had a hunch that a Google-specific Kubernetes implementation would help steer his company in the right direction.



## Between a rock and a hard place

Lind, who heads up the development team behind Humanitec’s main product, had been facing obstacles with an existing infrastructure built on Mesosphere. While that setup gave plenty of flexibility, its configuration and maintenance required significant DevOps capacity. This eventually became an obstacle to the company’s growth. 

The team then decided to turn to Kubernetes. With the help of a DevOps consultant, Lind and his team migrated to a cloud-based solution: Kubernetes on Hetzner. The result was a step in the right direction, but it still left a lot to be desired. 

The team faced problems with stability and management. Their biggest issue, however, was that they no longer had the same degree of control while using Hetzner’s cloud solution.



## Skill Sprint compass points the right way

It was then that Lind turned to Google as a possible solution. His belief was that Kubernetes, with the right implementation, would work for his team. Lind therefore approached Darwinist with the desire to smoothly introduce Kubernetes on Google to his team.

In a week-long Skill Sprint, an expert from Darwinist and two of Humanitec’s engineers completed a deep dive into the company’s CI/CD pipeline, kickstarted the implementation of Kubernetes on Google and began utilizing the infrastructure’s specific features. This collaboration with Darwinist brought Google cloud into the Humanitec development experience in both a practical and sustainable manner.



## Newfound skills and confidence

Ultimately, the exploration of Google-specific Kubernetes with Darwinist validated Lind’s proposed concept. Moreover, the engineers’ initial expectations were surpassed after they gained new skills through the Skill Sprint. The two participants in the Sprint noted the action-oriented, engaging nature of the program, after which they felt better equipped to act on necessary changes. 

With the experience gathered in just a week’s time, Humanitec’s engineers are forging ahead with lean infrastructure and optimized foundations for development.
