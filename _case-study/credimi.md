# Credimi solves a DevOps bottleneck in record time with a Kubernetes Skill Sprint

From its inception, Milan-based digital lending platform Credimi had always looked to build a continuous integration pipeline. The B2B company aims to be the fastest, simplest and most transparent of its kind, a vision that CTO Edmondo Porcu has extended onto his development team. Credimi embraced microservices from day one, but it soon found that managing all the architecture components was becoming increasingly complicated.



## An easy solution to a complex task

<p class="box has-background-dark">“Every time we needed to make a change, we had to set up all the right pieces,” Porcu said. “There was significant risk of broken code going through production and significant manual work required in order to test changes. Because one small change affected several microservices, it needed to be deployed by hand.”</p>

As Porcu began looking for a microservice architecture that was new and Docker-native, he chose Codefresh, the first CI/CD platform built for Kubernetes. As one of Codefresh’s first customers, Credimi enjoyed faster deployments, complexity reduction and automation in a fully cloud-based architecture.

Codefresh and Kubernetes brought opportunity for the Credimi development team, but two challenges still remained:

1) To set up the full pipeline enabled by these platforms
2) To bring knowledge to the development team that would allow it to unlock the full potential of these technologies



## Skill Sprint: transforming potential value into tangible value

Two of Porcu’s top engineers began working with the Skill Sprint expert over one week to achieve these crucial steps of migration and knowledge transfer.

<p class="box has-background-dark">“Our participating engineers ended up having a much clearer understanding of the different features of Kubernetes and how they should use them to get the best value,” Porcu said.</p>

That is the very idea behind the Skill Sprint methodology. Not only do developers get flexible new infrastructure, but they build it themselves and therefore truly own their pipeline.

<p class="box has-background-dark">“Our engineers worked with the Sprint Leader who discussed and guided their strategy. They were able to validate what they thought they should be doing,” Porcu said. “The expert was there to give help or provide quick scripts so that our engineers didn’t waste precious time and instead focused on the important work.”</p>

The Skill Sprint kept Credimi engineers in high gear for a full week, allowing them to migrate ten of their most tightly coupled services into a continuous delivery pipeline.
In the week immediately following the Sprint, Credimi engineers migrated an additional five to seven services. This completed the most critical part of their migration, while simultaneously putting to practice the knowledge obtained in the Sprint.



## An approach with longevity in mind

Credimi now has completed the largest chunk of their task and the team possesses the knowledge to finish the smaller migrations on their own. After the Skill Sprint, Credimi was able to resolve its “manual DevOps” bottleneck, create a clean microservice architecture and avoid any dependencies on expensive services. Porcu said:

<p class="box has-background-dark">“We are now considering doing similar Sprints internally, with the most experienced developers sharing their knowledge in a way that is sustainable and valuable. We feel as though we have invested in our staff without resorting to outside consultants.”</p>
