# Risk Department (Berlin)

Kyle, the head of risk in Berlin ordered a Skill Sprint to get the work of his team organised. Orkhan and Felix were already using Python for various risk management calculations since they were far past the point where Excel was useful due to the complexity and size of the data.

Whilst to some extent Felix and Orkhan were already developing software, they had no protocol. There was no change control of the code and there was no peer review of changes. Therefore, serious errors were starting to appear in their output. 

During the Skill Sprint sprint, their work flow was formalised with Github - a popular source control tool. This provided them with high quality change control and four eyed peer review.

Orkhan and Felix also learned how to use cloud resources from Amazon Web Services which allowed them access to much larger and more reliable computer resources which then further facilitated their journey with Artificial Intelligence based fraud detection. 

Kyle found that the work of his team is much more reliable since completing the Skill Sprint.

# Business Department (Berlin)

Marijana and Dusko are senior business managers for Access Holding. They are responsible for providing consultancy services to the group and cross pollination between the individual banks.

The Skill Sprint for Marijana and Dusko was run for a full week with the support and collaboration of the IT department. The focus of the Skill Sprint was teaching Marijana and Dusko how to extract and transform data from the core banking systems of the daughter Banks.

Marijana and Dusko showed very high aptitude for coding however their efforts were severely frustrated by lack of good quality data and difficulty providing a good quality development environment. 

Whilst the Skill Sprint was ultimately unsuccessful it helped everyone understand what could be done better in subsequent Skill Sprints - especially around access to data and development environments.

# Senior Managers (Zambia)

Mwaka is the head of risk and Marcus is the head of mobile payments (eTumba). Working together over one month two hours per day, we explored the core banking system relational database using a mix of Python and SQL. 

Based on the learnings of the previous skill sprint with Marijana and Dusko, high quality data and access to a good development environment were provided. 

Mwaka and Marcus learned to write complex queries and programs to extract and transform data from different sources. They gained a deep insight into the constraints, features and structure of the database and how that related to their business.

By the end they were able to quickly query and process millions of rows of data - far exceeding the capacity of their previous Excel based method. After the Skill Sprint, they reported feeling much more in-touch with the business and its IT systems and are planning on running further Skill Sprints for their subordinates.
