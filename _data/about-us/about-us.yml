  Andrew Holway, CEO of Darwinist, designed the Skill Sprint based on many years of experience in IT consulting, including working for the CERN on the LHC. 
  The main focus of this method is to achieve desirable goals with a learning-by-doing approach. 
  Andrew has been promoting Skill Sprints over the past five years as a response to the deficiencies in the technical training and consulting industries. 
  Andrew develops people-centric transformation methodologies and he has led dozens of companies and hundreds of employees toward growth and positive change.
