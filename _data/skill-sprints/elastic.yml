    description: 
      - Teams that have recently started using programming languages may need to start thinking about using version control to track changes to their code.
      - With code running on laptops comes a very high chance of sensitive data lying around on laptop hard-drives. This could present a serious compliance problem if the data contains personal information.
      - With people using their own laptops and not checking code into git for peer review there is often high error rates and less opportunity for collaboration between team members.
