      text: The thing I like most about Skill Sprints is the intensity. Nowadays companies donâ€™t have the time for the long and boring two times a week, 1-hour education lessons but they can offer their developers a week long Skill Sprint. Not only do developers learn but the business gets something tangible out of it. It is the ideal mix of investment into the education of your workers but also the business as a whole.

      text: Since I already had some previous knowledge about docker, scripting, networking, linux.. etc. the Skill Sprint made me combine it all together and took my knowledge to a whole new level. With this new hands-on experience in Kubernetes, the total lifecycle has become much clearer to me, boosting my development output. All of the knowledge I gathered in this Skill Sprint has definitely brought future projects to a higher standard.

      text: During 5 days of extensive work with Jilles we have successfully created a boilerplate pattern that later helped us refactor a part of our system from monolith to microservice. Overall a great experience and definitely worth while!
