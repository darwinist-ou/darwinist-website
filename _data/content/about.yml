company-introduction: 
  - Darwinist develops new techniques for technology education and adoption. Our methodologies are used to retool teams, invest in people, and evolve businesses.
  - Using, learning and creating technology is a social activity. However, the technology consulting and education services are trying to disconnect us from each other and push learners to online platforms which are ineffective and isolating. 
  - Our goal is to reintroduce things like apprenticeship through careful designed programme where teamwork is putted on the first place. Team of developers get knowledge through learning on the job process which already proved the efficiency. 
  - The technology industry is a monoculture of autodidacts who struggle with knowledge sharing. Darwinist brings strong instructional design principles to make our industry more accessible, more diverse and more social.
