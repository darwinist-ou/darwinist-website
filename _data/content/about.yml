      The story of our company began with our founder Andrew Holway's idea to help organizations invest effectively in their people by providing a training programme. The programme, meticulously developed over the years and tested by many organizations, has proven effective. In just a week, organizationsâ€™ employees can learn and, most importantly, apply what they have learned to their jobs.

      Skill Sprint is a unique methodology that includes the development of technical skills for development teams and business people and the development of soft skills such as leadership, responsibility, and a focus on results. 
      We are the adherents of the idea of effective investment in people.

      We believe that an organization consists of people who work first of all. For many employees,s work is a way to get money and an opportunity for self-realization and improvement of their skills. 
      We provide this opportunity and always strive to achieve our goals.
