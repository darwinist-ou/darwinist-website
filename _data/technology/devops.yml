  blurb:
      - text: |
          DevOps is the process of configuring cloud resources and automating the deployment of applications. 
      - text: |
          Because of the relatively high complexity and poor integration of cloud compute platforms like AWS the customer must invest in their own automation to consume the service. This automation is commonly described as DevOps.
      - text: |
          Platforms like Kubernetes have hugely decreased the amount of DevOps work to do by automating away most of the hard bits.
