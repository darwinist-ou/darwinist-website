  blurb:
    - text: |
        Access is a database management system (DBMS) first created in 1992. It is an easy-to-use tool for creating highly functional business applications, from templates or from scratch, in no time. 
    - text: |
        It is, however, severely limited compared to modern DBMS. The main limitations stem from its single file system: all data is stored in a single file with a finite size limit. Reaching it leads to lower performances.
