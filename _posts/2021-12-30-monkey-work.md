A few years ago, I discovered that my high paying tech job had been automated away by new technology from Google. Kubernetes was released as a free and open-source project to make deploying and managing applications much easier. My 'DevOps Engineer' role, specialising in deploying and managing these programs, was in jeopardy. As this new technology became ubiquitous, I have had to move on to new pastures.

Being a DevOps engineer was never particularly fulfilling. Calling it 'engineering' is a bit of a stretch. Lots of copy and pasting from the internet, very well paid monkey work. Work that was always on the table for being fully automated away, just as soon as the real engineers could get round to it. Which they did in 2014 with the first release of [**Kubernetes**](/technology/kubernetes/).

I still had valuable knowledge however. Like with any complex technology it is easy to get lost with Kubernetes. Utilising it properly requires the discovery of effective consumption patterns which are difficult to find. [**Skill Sprints**](/product/skill-sprint/) were originally designed to fix this specific problem.

Using this methodology I could upskill and enable a Development team with Kubernetes CI/CD deployments within a week. This process proved to be very successful at building this tacit knowledge into the tech team. There is no online learning in a Skill Sprint, too slow and inefficient for the developers’ valuable time, just me and a couple of devs locked in a room for a week until they were able to get their programs working on this new platform.

>There is a terrible myth in tech: Those who have the potential for coding can do so by taking some online course from providers such as Udacity or Code Academy. These providers are not incentivised by your success on these courses - only by your continuous engagement. For me, the idea that taking an online course can transform your career, is somewhat laughable. They just don't work for the vast majority of people. Especially for technical skills.

## Why do we struggle with technology education?

Tech knowledge is 'tacit knowledge' which makes it very difficult to share with other people. Tacit knowledge depends completely on the context of the problem that you're trying to solve. You can't just learn something from an online course and apply that in your daily work. Their examples are too abstract and they rarely teach you anything which has any real power. Tacit knowledge is learned on the job in collaboration with others.

![the forgetting curve](/img/post/forgetting-curve.png){:.blog-picture-left}
The Forgetting Curve makes the aquisition of technical knoweledge exceptionally difficult as our brains forget things almost as fast as you can learn. Forgetting is exponential. After 24 hours you have already lost 50%. After 7 days you would be lucky if you have retained 10% of what you learned. We can combat the forgetting curve by having very regular reviews.

Online courses don't care if you throw your precious time into the abyss, destroying hope and confidence along the way, but I do. If you want to learn to code then you have to deliver on a real use case within a defined process that respects your actual abilities to learn and retain information. Our [**Skill Sprints**](/product/skill-sprint/) provide a framework for learning and applying new abilities that directly address the problems in acquiring tacit knowledge and tool you up for combatting the forgetting curve.

Employers have known for some time that training is something of a bottomless pit. Time spent in training is time that the employee is not doing their job. It’s quite rare that an employee will come back from a training course with anything immediately useful to the business. The employee returns to a backlog of work and rapidly forgets everything that they just learnt. Skill Sprints are designed to revolutionise this pattern by delivering knowledge to the employee on the job. Rather than learning skills by manipulating tired artifacts in a training centre or online course - we work with the learners to directly deliver value to their organisation within the Skill Sprint process.

You can guarantee that the machines are coming for your job sometime in the future. Perhaps you have a lucky niche but if your job involves a lot of manual manipulation of spreadsheets, copying, pasting or other similar tasks then you can be sure that there is a team of developers somewhere working on the problem of automating your job. Our only hope is to automate it first and become the master of these machines.
