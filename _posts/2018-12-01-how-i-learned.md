Through all of this, Kubernetes effectively removes the need for a DevOps engineer. Yes, my job has theoretically been made redundant. But instead of accepting that fate, I now understand the real value I can bring to a development team in a way that’s cost-effective for them, and fulfilling for me. What was previously a 4-6 month delivery timeline has been reduced to one week. Solutions get delivered in a short amount of time to development teams, enabling them to consume Kubernetes directly. There are few other things that make my work as a developer more satisfying.

Today, at Otter Networks, we aim to bring all this value to development teams with our one week design sprint. Paired directly with the development team, we re-engineer the CI/CD pipelines using Kubernetes and give the team sufficient knowledge and ownership to consume Kubernetes directly. Without an ongoing reliance on a Devops engineer, teams are fully enabled to write better software. Ultimately, that helps them deliver unparalleled value directly to their customers.
