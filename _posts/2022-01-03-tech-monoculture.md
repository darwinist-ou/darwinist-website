Before we dig into the world of business automation via cloud technologies or other types of applications, it is worth mentioning that consuming every technology requires a thoughtful approach combined with constant skills development. The playground is full of possibilities for business evolution, and it is your choice to who you can trust. We at Darwinist provide safe and fast solutions for retooling and learning new technologies. [**Check our latest case studies**](/case-study/) to get more information about our work. And now, let us introduce you to the theatre of tech. 

Theatrics is probably not a word that technologists want associated with their projects. There is a projection of steady development. A graceful swan made its way across the genteel lake. In reality, tech is mostly some kind of improvised theatre. No one has a script, very few people have a clue and everyone is terrified of the reviews.

>For some, however, technology is very much a performance piece. I admire the way Elon Musk - a true theatre practitioner - performs the output of his companies. Launching his cherry red Tesla roadster into space on a ballet of technology was an effect not lost on many. At the time of writing, Tesla is worth more than Toyota despite Tesla producing about 3.5% of the volume of Toyota.

Technology dominates within the business. It is the medium in which we paint our ideas. Tech has a major role in every success and every failure. Since ‘these difficult times’, tech has saved us from the worst ravages of lockdown - connecting us and saving us from ourselves.

Seasoned performers understand the stage - the subtlety of the wing and the power of the front and center. Actors are able to use these positions to subliminally frame their work. Good actors will avoid front and center unless they want to make a specific point. They use the whole stage to tell their story. We can see this with tech companies. Facebook insists on standing front and center at all times - refusing to support in the wings. Other companies only hit that spot at specific times when they are ready to sing their aria. I should probably criticize Elon for his domination of the stage but I didn’t grow weary of him yet. We have our heroes and our villains, comedies, and tragedies, and plenty of high drama.

In 1984 The American educational theorist, David Kolb, described four distinct learning styles or modes:

>"*Technology is something of an autodidactic monoculture. People that make it into tech often have a stronger aptitude for focusing on tasks and self-learning. This can sometimes be at the expense of social aptitude. This rather narrow spectrum is causing stagnancy in significant portions of the industry as effective communication is often much more important than ‘engineering’ in many situations.*"

## Assimilating (watching and thinking - AC/RO)

The assimilating learning preference involves a concise, logical approach. Ideas and concepts are more important than people.

These people require a good clear explanation rather than a practical opportunity. They excel at understanding wide-ranging information and organizing it in a clear, logical format.

People with an assimilating learning style are less focused on people and more interested in ideas and abstract concepts. People with this style are more attracted to logically sound theories than approaches based on practical value.

This learning style is important for effectiveness in information and science careers. In formal learning situations, people with this style prefer readings, lectures, exploring analytical models, and having time to think things through.

Skill Sprints are designed to support people’s entry into the tech stage. We teach you to perform your small piece from the wings - what are the cues, entries, and exits? It will be quite some while before you will be front and center but we all have to start somewhere.
